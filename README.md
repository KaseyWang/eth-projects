# Ethereum Projects

<h3>Why are you making ETH projects and ERC20 Tokens?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It's fun and I like to learn
    <li>It's expressive artistically
    <li>To perhaps solve some problems
    <li>To become more organized and transparent
    <li>To show the blockchain's potentials beyond (or in addition to) money-grabs
    <li>To incidentally represent women/LGBT 'non-programmers' on the blockchain
</ul>

<h3>What are your ideas so far?</h3>

<i>Here's a freelisting exercise of projects. Please be aware: I have not yet looked into if the Ticker name, Emoji symbol, nor some details to these yet. Which idea do you want me to make? Do you want to make one? That's okay too. Please let me know here or on Twitter <a href="www.twitter.com/@kaseyjwang">@kaseyjwang</a>. Do not be shy. =^_^=</i>
